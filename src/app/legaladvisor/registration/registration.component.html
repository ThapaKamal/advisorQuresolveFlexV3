                            required to pay for such cancelled Orders and hence, the Merchant will not be paid at all
                            for such Orders.

                            When a Buyer cancels any Order after 1 (One) minute of placing such Order whether or not the
                            cancellation has been initiated by Swiggy or the Buyer, the Merchant shall be paid:

                            (a) In case of a prepaid Order: 100% (Hundred percent) of the Gross Value, subject to
                            adjusting the Service Fee, Other Charges and deductible arising out of applicable schemes,
                            if any;


                            (b) In case of a cash on delivery Order: 40% (Forty per cent) of the Gross Value pertaining
                            to the bills of such cancelled Order.


                            It should be noted that in cases of cash on delivery Order, Swiggy does not receive any
                            payments from the Buyer with respect to such cancelled Orders on the time of cancellation
                            and the amounts mentioned above is being paid by Swiggy as a goodwill gesture to Merchants.


                            It is understood and agreed by the Merchant, that it shall discharge Swiggy from all claims
                            it may have in such cancelled Order once Merchants receives the payment in the aforesaid
                            manner. Further, Swiggy alone shall have the right to recover Gross Value from Buyers
                            involved in such cancelled Orders, on behalf of the Merchants, as may be decided by Swiggy,
                            at its sole discretion.


                            Notwithstanding anything stated above, Merchant Protection for cancellation payment to the
                            Merchant will be against demonstration of good faith by the Merchants to the satisfaction of
                            Swiggy and Swiggy reserves the right to (i) refuse to pay to Merchant any amount upon
                            reasonable belief of mala fide or fraud on part of the Merchant (ii) recover any such
                            payment from the payouts upon acquiring knowledge of malafide or fraud on the part of
                            Merchant. However, if Swiggy determines to proceed with the payment as detailed above, the
                            same shall be accounted in the applicable Settlement Period.
